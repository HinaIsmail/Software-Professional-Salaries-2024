#  Software Professional Salaries 2024
Salaries for software professionals in 2024 can vary widely depending on factors such as location, level of experience, specific technology stack, and the company they work for. However, I can provide some general insights based on trends up to my last update in January 2022.

# Entry-Level Positions (0-2 years of experience):

In the United States, entry-level software engineers typically earn between $60,000 to $90,000 annually, with variations based on location (higher in tech hubs like San Francisco, New York, Seattle) and company size.
In other countries, such as India, entry-level salaries can range from â‚¹3,00,000 to â‚¹6,00,000 per annum.
# Mid-Level Positions (2-5 years of experience):

Mid-level software engineers in the US can expect salaries ranging from $90,000 to $120,000 annually.
In India, mid-level salaries can range from â‚¹6,00,000 to â‚¹12,00,000 per annum.

# Senior-Level Positions (5+ years of experience):

Senior software engineers or tech leads can earn anywhere from $120,000 to $200,000 or more annually in the US, depending on their expertise and the companies they work for.
In India, senior-level salaries can range from â‚¹12,00,000 to â‚¹30,00,000 per annum.

# Specialized Roles:

Salaries for specialized roles like machine learning engineers, data scientists, cybersecurity experts, etc., can be higher than average, often exceeding $150,000 annually in the US and varying widely based on demand and skill level.

# Management and Leadership Positions:

Salaries for engineering managers, directors, and executives can vary significantly based on the size and success of the company, but they often exceed $150,000 and can go well into the six-figure range.

These figures are indicative and can change based on various economic factors, industry trends, and demand for specific skills. It's always a good idea to research current salary data from reliable sources such as industry reports, salary surveys, and job postings in your area for the most accurate information.
